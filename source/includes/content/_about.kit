<h2>About MidfulBits</h2>
<p>Welcome to mindfulbits the simple home page of Pelham Scott Palmer. Thatâ€™s me. This page is not much more than support for my email and a place where you can learn a little about me and get in touch if you feel so inclined. </p>
<p>I am a lead Scrum Master at Cisco Stealthwatch were I have worked since early 2013. I hold certificates as a CSP, A-CSM, &amp; CSM. I am a Community Scrum Master lead for four teams and the Scrum Master for two teams, one local and one distributed. I spent 20 years as a developer and now enjoy spending my day coaching development teams.</p>
<p>Outside of work I am a husband and a father of three, my son, step-daughter and step-son, of whom all keep me very busy. In the free time that I have I enjoy cycling, camping, hiking and paddling amongst other things, more on those can be found below.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by and feel free to get in touch.</p>
